                          are more relevant to you and your interests. They are
                          also used to limit the number of times you see an ad,
                          as well as to help measure the effectiveness of an ad
                          campaign. They remember that you have visited a

                          after you have visited the Site, you may see some
                          advertisements about our services on other parts of

                          We may, in certain circumstances, use Adobe Flash
                          Player to deliver special content, such as video clips
                          or animation. To improve your user experience, Local
                          Shared Objects (commonly known as "Flash cookies") are
                          used to provide features such as remembering your
                          settings and preferences. Flash cookies are stored on
                          your device, but are managed through a different
                          interface than that provided by your web browser. This
                          means that it is not possible to manage Flash cookies
                          through your browser in the same way as you normally
                          would with cookies. Instead, you can access your Flash

                          Tailor-made content cookies help the Site provide
                          enhanced features and display content in a way that is
                          relevant to you. These cookies help the Site determine
                          what information to show you based on how you have
                          used the Site previously. These cookies do not track

                        <p>
                          These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that
                          are more relevant to you and your interests. They are
                          also used to limit the number of times you see an ad,
                          as well as to help measure the effectiveness of an ad
                          campaign. They remember that you have visited a
                          website and this information can be shared with other
                          organizations, such as advertisers. This means that
                          after you have visited the Site, you may see some
                          advertisements about our services on other parts of
                          the Internet.

                        <p>
                          The length of time a cookie will remain on your
                          navigation device depends on whether it is a
                          "persistent" cookie or "session" cookie. Session
                          cookies will only remain on your device until you stop
                          browsing. Persistent cookies remain on your navigation
                          device until they expire or are deleted.
